# Phase 6: the weight-24 floor bridge substrate (A4 §§10–11) — M1b

`WtFloor24.lean` (M1a) proved the standard-form walk `Sab_ge_6` (`S(a,b) ≥ 6`
for all `16` pairs).  This module is the **bridge substrate** that an eventual
analytic discharge of the two weight-24 floor leaves will consume: the verified
plumbing connecting the closed coset-weight form `costFromComps` (the hypothesis
of `floor_of_data_analytic`) to the per-slot / per-block `slotCost` machinery.

## What is verified here (all consumed by the eventual reduction)

* **`rmul_{Bhat2,Ahat1,Ahat4}_mem`** — the radical-multiplier image lies in the
  16-element ideal `{αD + β·uv}`: `rmul D r = αD + β·uv` for some `α, β`
  (kernel `decide` over the 256-element `Ring` via `mkRing`).  This is what lets
  a coset's constrained component `off + D·(Vⱼ f)` be rewritten as a finite
  `(α, β)`-indexed ideal element.
* **`inIdeal_to_exists`** — the `Bool` membership `inIdeal D r` to the `Prop`
  existential `∃ a b, r = αD + β·uv` (so the `_mem` facts give a usable witness).
* **`sum_zmod2sq`** — expands a slot sum `∑ s : Z₂², g s` to its four explicit
  slots `g(0,0)+g(1,0)+g(0,1)+g(1,1)`, matching `allS = (e,x,y,xy)`.
* **`slotCost_le'` / `slotCostL_le'`** — `slotCost`/`slotCostL` lower-bound
  `wt5OfComps` for any component-0 value `v₀ < 2` (the `Fin 2 ↪ Fin 4` bridge of
  the `Fin 2`-stated `slotCost_le`/`slotCostL_le`).
* **`V_psi0_lt2`, `comp0_lt2_{L,R}`** — component 0 of every coset element is
  `F₂`-valued (`V ψ₀` is a parity sum), discharging the `v₀ < 2` side-conditions.
* **`costFromComps_ge_blockSlotCost`** — the block split (first half of the
  bridge): `costFromComps ≥ (∑ₛ slotCostL Lᵢ) + (∑ₛ slotCost Rᵢ)`
  (`Finset.sum_add_distrib` + the per-slot bounds).
* **`slotCost_frob`, `slotCostL_frob`, `slotCost_scale`** — the cost-preserving
  moves (Lemma 25): per-slot cost is invariant under entrywise Frobenius (both
  blocks) and under the rigidity-preserving scaling `s₂² = s₃s₄` (right block).
* **`RBlock_std_ge6`** — the standard-form right block (`off₄ = ωθ`) is `≥ 6`
  even with the spine direction freed (`Prop 29` realized through `slotCost`).
* **`costFromComps_ge_12_of_blocks`** — the **wt-24 close**: per-block `slotCost`
  slot sums both `≥ 6` ⟹ closed coset weight `≥ 12`, ready for
  `floor_of_data_analytic`.

## Which reps this discharges (the orbit-type finding)

The decisive empirical fact (per-block decoupled minima, by `#eval`): the two
**weight-24** reps `Y11`, `Y12` have `(min_R, min_L) = (6, 6)`, so they
**decouple** — each block independently reaches `6`, hence `costFromComps ≥ 12`
with **no `ρ`-links and no Lemma-27 reduction** (`MImFloorY{11,12}` discharge
their floor analytically via `costFromComps_ge_12_of_blocks`, dropping the `2³⁰`
`floorOK` leaf).  The other three reps are the **light orbits**: `Y0` is `(4,4)`,
`Y1`/`Y4` are `(3,3)` — per-block `< 6`, so they need the weight-10 kill and the
`ρ`-links (M2/M3), *not* covered here.  (An earlier read mis-tagged `Y4` as
wt-24; the `decide` characterisation corrected it.)

The cost-preserving moves (`slotCost(L)_frob`, `slotCost_scale`) and
`RBlock_std_ge6` are retained as the standard-form-reduction building blocks for
the light orbits / any non-decoupling rep.

Everything here is **axiom-clean** including the three `rmul_*_mem` facts, now
kernel `decide` over the 256-element ring via `mkRing` (the same foundational-ring category as
`CRTFrame`'s `*_ann_eq_ideal` / `*_ideal_ge3`, not the `2³⁰` floor leaf).

/-! ## §1 Radical-multiplier image membership and the ideal-element witness

A coset's constrained component is `offset ⊕ D·(Vⱼ f)` for a radical multiplier
`D ∈ {Â₁, Â₄, B̂₂}`. Since `D² = 0`, the image `rmul D r` lies in the 16-element
ideal `{αD + β·uv}` for every `r` (a finite check over the 256-element `Ring`,
which is a `Fintype`). `inIdeal_to_exists` turns the `Bool` certificate into the
`Prop` existential the rewrite needs. -/

`v₀, v₂`) and the B/right block frees its unit-side component 1 (`slotCost`
frees `v₀, v₁`). This is the link-free reduction; the per-block `≥ 6` second
half needs the standard-form reduction (see the module header). -/

/-- **Block split.** `costFromComps` dominates the sum of the A-block
`slotCostL` slot sum and the B-block `slotCost` slot sum (component 0
`F₂`-valued on both). -/

per rep from the radical-ideal image + the standard-form walk) feed straight
into `floor_of_data_analytic`. Component 0's `F₂`-valuedness is discharged

/-! ## §5 Cost-preserving moves (Lemma 25) — the reduction building blocks

The per-slot cost is invariant under the cost-preserving moves used to reduce a
raw weight-24 block to standard form: entrywise Frobenius (a value-table
symmetry, both blocks) and the rigidity-preserving scaling `s₂² = s₃s₄` (the
nine cell symmetries; for the right block, whose confined component is component
2). The scaling does *not* hold for the left block as stated (`slotCostL`
confines component 1 and scaling the `F₂` component 0 breaks its parity), so the
L-block reduction routes through its own frame `ℓ' = κ(Â₃)`. -/

/-- **Lemma 25 (Frobenius), right block.** `slotCost` is invariant under
entrywise squaring. -/

/-! ## §6 The standard-form right block reaches `≥ 6` (the reduction endpoint)

With the standard offsets (component 2 confined to `⟨ℓ⟩` through the origin,
component 3 on `⟨ℓ⟩`, component 4 at `ωθ = (ω,0,ω,0)` off the line), the right
block sums to `≥ 6` over the four slots even after freeing the spine direction —
exactly `Prop 29` realized through `slotCost`. (The raw `Y4` offsets do *not*
satisfy this; they must first be reduced via §5, the remaining M1b work.) -/

/-- **Standard right block `≥ 6`.** With `off₂ = off₃ = 0` and `off₄ = ωθ`, the
B/right block's `slotCost` slot sum is `≥ 6` for every confined/spine ideal
datum (`B̂₂` slot values `(ω²,ω,1,0)`, `uv ≡ 1`). The 4⁶-knob walk stays
kernel-checked (axiom-clean); `+kernel` and the packed-`Nat` tables keep it
cheap. -/
