# The weight-12 nontrivial cycle of the gross code

Headline (`gross_exists_weight12_nontrivial_cycle`): the gross complex has a
1-cycle of weight 12 that is not a boundary, namely the pullback `τ(u*)` of
the weight-6 base cycle `u*` whose right block is

  `z* = 1 + y + y² + y⁵ + x³ + x³y⁴`  (satisfying `A ⋆ z* = 0` over `Z₆ × Z₆`).

Non-boundaryness is certified by an explicit dual witness `w` with
`dualBoundary w = 0` and `⟨w, τ(u*)⟩ = 1`, fed to
`not_mem_boundaries_of_dual_witness`.  The witness support was found by `𝔽₂`
row reduction offline; its provenance is irrelevant since both defining
properties are re-checked here by kernel `decide` (via the transpose formula
`bb_dualBoundary_eq`).

## Convention bridge (lab notes → repo)

Repo convention: `∂₂ f = (A⋆f | B⋆f)`, `∂₁ c = B⋆c_L + A⋆c_R`; cycle
condition `B⋆v_L = A⋆v_R`.  **Repo-left = lab-right** — hence `u*` carries
`z*` in the *right* block (so `∂₁ u* = B⋆0 + A⋆z* = 0`).
